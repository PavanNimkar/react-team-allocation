# ðŸ‘¥ Team Allocation Project (React)

This is a **React-based team allocation application** that I built while learning React.  
It allows you to **assign employees to teams**, manage state with React hooks, and persist data using **localStorage**.  

The project demonstrates **core React concepts** including components, props, state management, event handling, and data persistence.
